# to build:

>> docker build -f ubuntu-base.docker -t ubuntu-base .
>> docker build -f download-repos.docker -t repos .

>> docker run -it --hostname=Rapidash-Docker --name=repos-container repos
    * clone all repos that require passwords

    BEFORE EXITING THE INTERACTIVE SESSION SAVE CURRENT IMAGE IN ANOTHER WINDOW:
    >> docker save -o repos.save repos
    * then can exit from interactive session using ">> exit"

Then to load this image with all the changes that were made during the interactive session:
    >> docker load -i repos.save

To go back into the interactive mode of that container:
    >> docker start -i repos-container

now make the image based on the container
    >> docker commit -m "repos cloned" repos-container repos

ALL REPOS SHOULD BE CLONED THAT ARE PASSWORD PROTECTED - continue with dockerfiles

>> docker build -f openmpi.docker -t openmpi .
>> docker build -f qt.docker -t qt .
>> docker build -f hdf5.docker -t hdf5 .
